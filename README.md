Simple Google Colab notebook to generate cryptocurrency wallet addresses
using [VanityGenPLUS.](https://web.archive.org/web/20190427070703/github.com/exploitagency/vanitygen-plus)

This notebook has:
* GPU runtimes support
* Generation parameters available via GUI form

Google Colab notebook is available [here.](https://colab.research.google.com/github/dreamscached/vanitygen-colab/blob/master/VanityGen.ipynb)

Note: as this notebook heavily uses CPU/GPU for computing a lot of crypto related things, 
your Google Colab account [will likely get banned](https://github.com/dreamscached/vanitygen-colab/issues/4).
In the event of this happening you can submit a ban appeal and Colab support seems to approve it fairly quickly.
